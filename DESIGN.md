## 🪐Vision and Mission

It's not people like using chatbots, long conversations or sophisticated prompts. It's just so far the best intereface for general public to enjoy the computing powers. We believe there should be better ways to interact than long chat.

Finae's vision is to create a new human-computer interaction, in-between natural language and Python (rigorous than natural language, concised than Python), so called **keyword-oriented** or **hint-oriented** programming styles.
